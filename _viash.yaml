summary: "Removing noise in sparse single-cell RNA-sequencing count data"
description: |
    A key challenge in evaluating denoising methods is the general lack of a ground truth. A
    recent benchmark study ([Hou et al.,
    2020](https://genomebiology.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13059-020-02132-x))
    relied on flow-sorted datasets, mixture control experiments ([Tian et al.,
    2019](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41592-019-0425-8)), and comparisons with bulk
    RNA-Seq data. Since each of these approaches suffers from specific limitations, it is
    difficult to combine these different approaches into a single quantitative measure of
    denoising accuracy. Here, we instead rely on an approach termed molecular
    cross-validation (MCV), which was specifically developed to quantify denoising accuracy
    in the absence of a ground truth ([Batson et al.,
    2019](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/786269v1)). In MCV, the observed molecules
    in a given scRNA-Seq dataset are first partitioned between a *training* and a *test*
    dataset. Next, a denoising method is applied to the training dataset. Finally, denoising
    accuracy is measured by comparing the result to the test dataset. The authors show that
    both in theory and in practice, the measured denoising accuracy is representative of the
    accuracy that would be obtained on a ground truth dataset.

  motivation: |
    Single-cell RNA-Seq protocols only detect a fraction of the mRNA molecules present
    in each cell. As a result, the measurements (UMI counts) observed for each gene and each
    cell are associated with generally high levels of technical noise ([Grün et al.,
    2014](https://www.nature.com/articles/nmeth.2930)). Denoising describes the task of
    estimating the true expression level of each gene in each cell. In the single-cell
    literature, this task is also referred to as *imputation*, a term which is typically
    used for missing data problems in statistics. Similar to the use of the terms "dropout",
    "missing data", and "technical zeros", this terminology can create confusion about the
    underlying measurement process ([Sarkar and Stephens,
    2020](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.04.07.030007v2)).
