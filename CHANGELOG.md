### NEW FUNCTIONALITY

* `api/file_*`: Created a file format specifications for the h5ad files throughout the pipeline.

* `api/comp_*`: Created an api definition for the split, method and metric components.

* `process_dataset`: Added a component for processing common datasets into task-ready dataset objects.

* `resources_test/denoising/pancreas` with `src/tasks/denoising/resources_test_scripts/pancreas.sh`.

* `workflows/run`: Added nf-tower test script. (PR #205)

### V1 MIGRATION

* `control_methods/no_denoising`: Migrated from v1. Extracted from baseline method

* `control_methods/perfect_denoising`: Migrated from v1.Extracted from baseline method

* `methods/alra`: Migrated from v1. Changed from python to R and uses lg_cpm normalised data instead of L1 sqrt

* `methods/dca`: Migrated and adapted from v1.

* `methods/knn_smoothing`: Migrated and adapted from v1.

* `methods/magic`: Migrated from v1.

* `metrics/mse`: Migrated from v1.

* `metrics/poisson`: Migrated from v1.

### Changes from V1

* Anndata layers are used to store data instead of obsm

* extended the use of sparse data in methods unless it was not possible

* process_dataset also removes unnecessary data from train and test datasets not needed by the methods and metrics.
