  summary: "Removing noise in sparse single-cell RNA-sequencing count data"
  description: "A key challenge in evaluating denoising methods is the general lack\
    \ of a ground truth. A\nrecent benchmark study ([Hou et al.,\n2020](https://genomebiology.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13059-020-02132-x))\n\
    relied on flow-sorted datasets, mixture control experiments ([Tian et al.,\n2019](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41592-019-0425-8)),\
    \ and comparisons with bulk\nRNA-Seq data. Since each of these approaches suffers\
    \ from specific limitations, it is\ndifficult to combine these different approaches\
    \ into a single quantitative measure of\ndenoising accuracy. Here, we instead\
    \ rely on an approach termed molecular\ncross-validation (MCV), which was specifically\
    \ developed to quantify denoising accuracy\nin the absence of a ground truth ([Batson\
    \ et al.,\n2019](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/786269v1)). In MCV, the\
    \ observed molecules\nin a given scRNA-Seq dataset are first partitioned between\
    \ a *training* and a *test*\ndataset. Next, a denoising method is applied to the\
    \ training dataset. Finally, denoising\naccuracy is measured by comparing the\
    \ result to the test dataset. The authors show that\nboth in theory and in practice,\
    \ the measured denoising accuracy is representative of the\naccuracy that would\
    \ be obtained on a ground truth dataset.\n"

    motivation: "Single-cell RNA-Seq protocols only detect a fraction of the mRNA\
      \ molecules present\nin each cell. As a result, the measurements (UMI counts)\
      \ observed for each gene and each\ncell are associated with generally high levels\
      \ of technical noise ([Gr√ºn et al.,\n2014](https://www.nature.com/articles/nmeth.2930)).\
      \ Denoising describes the task of\nestimating the true expression level of each\
      \ gene in each cell. In the single-cell\nliterature, this task is also referred\
      \ to as *imputation*, a term which is typically\nused for missing data problems\
      \ in statistics. Similar to the use of the terms \"dropout\",\n\"missing data\"\
      , and \"technical zeros\", this terminology can create confusion about the\n\
      underlying measurement process ([Sarkar and Stephens,\n2020](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.04.07.030007v2)).\n"
